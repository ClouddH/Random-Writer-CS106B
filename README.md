# Random-Writer
2nd assignment from stanford's programming abstraction.

Project specification:
https://see.stanford.edu/materials/icspacs106b/H16-Assign2ADTs.pdf

Official stanford demo available under     RandomWriterDemo.app file 

My Notes:

In this assignment , I practiced with simple data structure . By analyzing source text and building a markov model with 
simple structures like map and vector , my random writer is able to generate bogus writing that resembles source text in 
writing style .
